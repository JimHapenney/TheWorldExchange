        <br />SECURITY.  The World Exchange website does not include its own encryption or other security measures, and any communications with Ripple via The World Exchange website are protected only by any security that Ripple (or other third parties) may provide.  You are responsible for your own security of your keys and transactions whether generated by this site or not.

Any violations of the laws are liable to you, the end user, only and will not be the responsibility of The World Exchange, its creators, or its operators.  Lastly, you acknowledge that there is substantial legal and regulatory risk in dealing with blockchain-based tokens, as the landscape for such technologies is constantly evolving, and this risk is similarly solely your own responsibility.

        <br /><br />NO INVESTMENT ADVICE.  You agree that to the extent you purchase tokens or other assets via Ripple, the seller of such tokens or assets is solely responsible for creating or providing all information and/or documentation relevant and necessary to assess and execute the purchase of such tokens or assets (including without limitation any document describing the tokens or assets (sometimes referred to as a “whitepaper”) and any contract memorializing such purchase of tokens or assets) and that The World Exchange does not, and neither The World Exchange nor its creators or operators have any responsibility or obligation to do so.	You understand that The World Exchange, its creators, and its operators provide no transaction or investment advice of any kind, nor do The World Exchange, its creators, or its operators give advice or offer any opinion with respect to the nature, potential value or suitability of any particular transaction or investment strategy.

        <div id='issuerInfo' class='disclaimer'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every token traded is issued/created by someone else out there, whether it be a person issuing tokens to represent personal loans/debt and credit or a company issuing tokens to represent their bonds and equity.  Or it could represent something completely different and unheard of - such as new currencies or tokens to represent ideas, projects, anything.  It is being able to fundraise for anything and create a fully tradable token to represent it.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can create their own tokens by issuing them; it's on you to communicate to the world what the tokens represent and to enforce that.  Think of it like creating a credit card; it's not cash but the creator of the card enforces the value.  In the case of peer-to-peer lending, one can create a token for others to buy with the creator's promise to buy back the token later, just like the concept of getting a loan and paying it back later.  The value of a token here will always be determined by how much everyone trusts the creator to back it, just like how anything else works in the real world.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you create your own token, you can then tell others to buy or sell it by directing them to this site and giving them the name of the token and your account address as the backer/issuer.  Your token will be traded just like any other token that exists on the exchange with its value determined completely by the free market.
        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Ripple's autobridging technology, a token offered for Ripple's native currency XRP will automatically be offered on every orderbook that exists.  For example, if you offer XYZ for XRP, everyone will automatically see XYZ also available for USD, EUR, BTC, etc, simultaneously every form of exchange and creating immediate liquidity.  You can always still offer directly to one symbol such as USD if you do not wish to make it available universally.</div>

        <div id='trustlinesInfo' class='disclaimer'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every token is issued and created by some individual, company, or organization.  Every user has the choice to decide what others are allowed to send to him/her.  Before sending anything to a recipient, make sure the recipient has set their "Receivable Tokens" to be able to accept the token you are about to send.  If you are expecting to receive a token, make sure the token and who backs it are in your "Receivable Tokens" list.  All of this is done, so that you do not accidentally receive tokens backed by people/companies you do not trust or know.  You do not need to do this for tokens you buy, sell, or issue, only for what others send you.  An exception is if an issuer requires token holders be authorized or approved, in which case you'll get a message that you need to add the token to your "Receivable Tokens" list before trading as well.  The one token that does not require any of this is Ripple's native currency XRP, which no one can issue and therefore can't be faked.  Note that Ripple's <a href='https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/#trust-lines-and-issuances' target='_blank'>Gateway documentation</a> refers to these lists as trustlines.</div>

Something that most issuers will want to check is "defaultRipple."  By default, it is disabled so only the issuer is be able to send or offer the token to others; if you would like users to do the same, make sure to enable the "defaultRipple" setting for your account.  Another commonly used feature is requireAuthorization, which requires both the buyer and issuer to add each other under their respective "Receivable Tokens" and "Authorized Token Holders" lists before the token can be traded or received.  The third major setting is the "<a href='https://wiki.ripple.com/Master_Key' target='_blank'>RegularKey</a>" which allows you to use the secret key of another account to login, protecting you from having to put your main secret key (the "MasterKey") at risk.  Features like this allow more tightly regulated businesses to integrate their KYC/AML needs directly into the token without additional code or smart contracts.</div>

        <h3>What is The World Exchange?</h3>
        <h4>A free, open exchange<a href='#works' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>*</a> where anyone can trade, issue, and send anything anywhere in real time.</h4>
        
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine being able to send money, credit, assets - any form of ownership or value - to anyone anywhere in the world in mere seconds.  Then imagine being able to trade or bid on those same items online with anyone else in the world.  And finally imagine being able to actually issue your <i>own</i> symbols as well to represent anything you can think of - and then let people send or trade that just as openly as they trade anything else, its value determined completely by the free market.  That's what The World Exchange is, and it does this by using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> protocol - a technology allowing for truly decentralized exchanges with no downtime and no middlemen in control of your funds.</p>
          
          <h5 id='instant'><a href='#instant' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Near-Instantaneous, Auditable Transactions and Settlements</a></h5>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say goodbye to ACH, bank wires, SWIFT, T+2 settlement, and other slow 20th century financial technologies.  Money and virtually any other asset can now be sent pretty much instantly anywhere in the world, and unlike Bitcoin or other Blockchain-based technologies, you never have to deal with any currency other than the one you're using.  Everything is automatically and seamlessly converted in between without anyone ever having to see it.  Instead of just using USD to buy a symbol XYZ, you can now directly buy XYZ with another asset ABC.  If something is offered in exchange for USD, it is automatically also offered in EUR, BTC, XRP, and all other pairs.  All the liquidity and conversion is done behind the scenes so that all markets for every symbol out there is essentially on one global, interconnected orderbook.  No more worrying about what currency to convert to first or what cross-pairs have the best pricing.  You can essentially now send and trade pure value in near real-time.  Best of all, everything is automatically recorded permanently and publicly auditable by anyone with no work on your end.</p>
          

          <h5 id='represent'><a href='#represent' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Issue Tokens to Represent Any Form of Value or Ownership</a></h5>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near-instant transactions are amazing but only the tip of the iceberg. You can do so much more than just send or trade quickly.  You can also create your own symbols to represent anything you can think of.  The common description for this now is issuing your own token.  It is not just a payments or settlement protocol.  Everyone can now be their own broker, exchange, custodian, banker, accountant, auditor - the whole process of any financial institution is do-able by anyone online at the click of a mouse.  By using the <a href='#' onclick='setURL("?action=issue"); $("#action").val("issue"); $("#symbol1").val(""); $("#symbol2").val(""); updateAction(); jQuery("html,body").animate({scrollTop: jQuery("#container").offset().top}, 1000); return false;'>Issue</a> button, you can create tokens to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Represent your company, its shares, or debt - aka, an IPO / ITO / ICO or bond offering.</li>
          <li>Fundraise for an idea, project, or cause - aka crowdfunding.</li>
          <li>Represent yourself for a loan - aka peer-to-peer lending or crowdsourced credit score.</li>
          <li>Offer rewards, gift cards, game currencies - anything redeemable in real world.</li>
          <li>Show indisputable proof of record via text on transactions - automated audit trail, peer-to-peer notary.</li>
          <li>Store information forever without running any servers - archives, wikis, even the chat on this very site.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pretty much anything else you can creatively think of.  The token is then openly tradable with its price determined entirely by the free market, just like with any stock, bond, rating, currency, etc.  In addition, thanks to the automatic conversion behind the scenes, you only need to offer the symbol once for it to automatically be available across every symbol there is, instantly accepting any form of exchange without additional effort.  You can see this yourself with a live example TTT, which is offered only once for XRP <a href='https://www.theworldexchange.net/?symbol1=TTT.rBcA1MkS2jtywAAi9bWfGsUk9R6RWQAyKr&symbol2=XRP' target='_blank'>here</a> but automatically also available across <a href='https://www.theworldexchange.net/?symbol1=TTT.rBcA1MkS2jtywAAi9bWfGsUk9R6RWQAyKr&symbol2=USD' target='_blank'>USD</a>, <a href='https://www.theworldexchange.net/?symbol1=TTT.rBcA1MkS2jtywAAi9bWfGsUk9R6RWQAyKr&symbol2=EUR' target='_blank'>EUR</a>, and <a href='https://www.theworldexchange.net/?symbol1=TTT.rBcA1MkS2jtywAAi9bWfGsUk9R6RWQAyKr&symbol2=BTC' target='_blank'>BTC</a>.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, you would either buy back the token you issued or offer some other form of exchange/reward/redemption to give it value.  The trust that you do that is why people would buy or accept your token in the real world.  It is your job to enforce and communicate that promise.  It is no different than a credit card issued by a bank, a gift card issued by a store, someone buying a stock on the trust that the company makes money for its shareholders, or a loan being offered on the trust that the borrower pays it back with interest.  Those that break that trust would find it difficult to do business in the future, just like with anything else in the real world.  The most important part is that every transaction on the exchange is permanent and there for all to see, so no one can ever lie and get away with it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: The site here only takes care of the technology behind this.  If you're creating a token sale (ICO / ITO) or other serious projects, make sure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  See <a href='#ico' onclick='setURL("#ico"); jQuery("html,body").animate({scrollTop: jQuery("#ico").offset().top}, 1000); return false;'>Extra Considerations for Creating a Token Offering</a>.</p>
          
          <h5 id='global'><a href='#global' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Global and Decentralized - No Middlemen and No Downtime</a></h5>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best part is all of this can be done in the same place.  Anything of value can now be traded directly for each other - shares for other shares, commodities for loans, tokens for bonds, etc.  More importantly, this "exchange" is owned by no one and is equally open to everyone on the planet, quite literally eliminating all middlemen in anything to do with transactions and exchange but also any central point of failures for security, traffic load, or otherwise.  <b>The World Exchange is not really a place or even an exchange.</b>  It is an interface to a global, decentralized network that is scattered across the world in the same way the internet is.  The technology behind that network is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> consensus ledger protocol, and like the internet, it is everywhere and controlled by no one.  The World Exchange is but a mere internet service provider connecting you to it.  <b>Nothing is stored or run through The World Exchange site itself</b>.  Everything is directly between you and the decentralized network of other users.  There is no custodian, no broker, no counterparty.  As long as you save your account address and secret key, your account is safe even if this site goes down.  You don't even need this site to trade and keep using your account.  In fact, you can actually save this page to your desktop and access the network without anyone's server.  To test this, you can have your firewalls block theworldexchange.net after downloading the page.  <b>You can even disconnect your computer from the internet completely and just create an address to deposit funds into.</b>  The site literally doesn't do anything other than offer you the webpage for download.  There is <b>no downtime ever</b> because there is no actual exchange to overload, and there is <b>no data to be lost to any security breaches</b> because no data is actually passed through or stored on the site.  This is an exchange in name only that allows anyone can trade or transact with other users directly with no one else in between, and like the internet, this "exchange" is forever online as long as there are other users just like yourself.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way a truly decentralized exchange should be.  Unfortunately, a lot of exchanges out there that advertise or even use Blockchain are not actually decentralized at all; they control your accounts, store your passwords/keys, are a central point of failure that loses everyone's funds if they get hacked, etc.  In fact, such exchanges are literally just traditional exchanges which happen to trade cryptocurrencies and are not actually leveraging the technology behind Blockchain at all.  The horror stories with Mt. Gox, Bitfinex - where users have lost money to hacks, crashes of the exchange, etc - all occur on these kinds of traditional exchanges that just happen to be trading cryptocurrencies.  It's like someone trying to sell you a self-driving car but insisting you still pay them to be your driver.  They do this so they can charge you the same fees as the older technology, while keeping all the cost savings of new technology to themselves.  Imagine if you paid a driver who just pushed the on button for the self-driving car.  A truly decentralized exchange would make all traditional exchanges obsolete.  Such is the case with The World Exchange, which really is not an exchange at all but just an interface to an already existing decentralized exchange technology (aka Blockchain); the one we use here is called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> and is one of many competing technologies against the original Bitcoin-based Blockchain.  More tech-savvy users will understand this to be a <b>fully client-side wallet</b>, where your account credentials remain in your control at all times and are never sent anywhere.  It is the <b>most secure way to store funds</b>, quite literally because you never give your information to anyone else to begin with.  This is the way a truly decentralized exchange should be, and the purpose of this site is to demonstrate that it is not only possible but efficient.</p>
          
          
          <h5 id='started'><a href='#started' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>How to Get Started</a></h5>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quickest way to get started is to create an account on the Login page or use an existing Ripple address if you have one.  Those who have created addresses or wallets at other Ripple-based sites, such as <a href='http://www.rippletrade.com/' target='_blank'>RippleTrade</a> or <a href='https://www.gatehub.net/' target='_blank'>Gatehub</a>, will be able to use the exact same account and secret keys here because it's the same Ripple network behind the scenes.  More step-by-step video tutorials on account creation, funding, and other actions are also available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHAK7FXoElZOyM6MaQ_O_i6ATap2k9r-o' target='_blank'>YouTube</a>.</p>
          <p id='started_minXRP'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_minXRP' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Min XRP and Transaction Fee</a></b>: After creating an account, the account requires a <a href='https://ripple.com/build/reserves/' target='_blank'>minimum amount of XRP</a> to be activated.  XRP is the native currency on the Ripple network with no issuer or backer.  The starting minimum is 20 XRP, with each additional symbol you want to hold requiring an additional 5 XRP minimum.  For example, if you want to trade both USD and EUR, you would need a minimum 30 XRP (20 base + 5 per symbol).  This is all done to prevent spam and other issues.  While the technology is free, a small amount of XRP is burned each time a transaction happens, so bad actors cannot flood the network with fake orders or issuances.  It is not an amount paid out to someone and is part of the Ripple protocol itself (see <a href='https://ripple.com/build/rippleapi/#transaction-fees' target='_blank'>Ripple transaction fees).</a></p>
          <p id='started_funding'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_funding' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Funding an Account</a></b>: The easiest way to fund your account is to use a Ripple activation service like <a href="https://www.bithomp.com/activation/" target="_blank">Bithomp</a>, which allows you to buy XRP with traditional payment methods like PayPal to fund your newly created account.  Beyond that, you would go to the issuers themselves like <a href='https://www.bitstamp.net' target='_blank'>Bitstamp</a> or <a href='https://www.gatehub.net/' target='_blank'>Gatehub</a>, who as described more below will exchange and redeem any token they back on the Ripple network for real-world currencies (including USD and EUR).  Specifically, you would be looking for exchanges or firms that allow withdrawal or deposit via Ripple (which The World Exchange runs on); you'll know when you see a Ripple address for deposit or withdrawal of currencies and other tickers.  Lastly, you can go to cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://www.poloniex.com/" target="_blank">Poloniex</a> or <a href='https://www.kraken.com/' target='_blank'>Kraken</a> to buy XRP before sending it to your new account, but note they can only send and receive XRP from the Ripple Network because they don't issue or back any tokens (they are just traditional exchanges).  Once you have something in your account, you can trade it for any other token on the Ripple network using a site like this one, but just be careful with sending back out.  Unless the receiving service or exchange is an issuer / Gateway also built on Ripple, it will only accept XRP.  Longer term, this should change as more institutions adopt the network.  A list of other sites and how to use them can be found on Ripple's <a href='https://ripple.com/xrp/buy-xrp/' target='_blank'>How to Buy XRP</a> page.  A video walk-throughs of funding with the sites mentioned above are also available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgCKwaSg1kk&index=2&list=PLHAK7FXoElZOyM6MaQ_O_i6ATap2k9r-o' target='_blank'>YouTube</a>.</p>
          <p id='started_issuers'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_issuers' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Tokens and Issuers</a></b>: All tokens except XRP are issued by someone or some company.  Their value is dependent on people's trust that whoever created the token will redeem or do other things to maintain the value; for example, if some bank issues the token XYZ to represent actual USD, they should be willing to redeem you in real cash if you send the token back to them.  It's like credit cards from a bank or gift cards from a store, which otherwise have no value unless the issuing group maintains it.  In the meantime, you can then use the XYZ token with others that accept it as a substitute for what it represents (the cash).  The person that offers the promise to redeem is called the issuer or <a href='https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/' target='_blank'>Gateway</a> (in Ripple's official terms).  You can find existing known issuers for any token by typing the token symbol into The World Exchange and clicking on the <b>"Backed by ..."</b> link to browse the list (or input an issuer address manually).  If you look up any particular issuer's name, you should be able to find details on how to redeem from them or use their site to go back and forth between real-world currencies/assets and the symbols on the Ripple network.</p>
          <p id='started_buyingSelling'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_buyingSelling' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Buying and Selling</a></b>: Buying and selling is as straight forward as just inputting the symbols of what you want to buy or sell, how much, and what price.  Then just click the Submit button.  A video walk-through is available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTKVvY3VIZg&list=PLHAK7FXoElZOyM6MaQ_O_i6ATap2k9r-o&index=3' target='_blank'>YouTube</a> if you're still not sure.</p>
          <p id='started_receivableTokensList'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_receivableTokensList' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Sending and Receiving</a></b>: You must explicitly allow each token and issuer you want to receive before anyone can send you anything.  If you are expecting to receive anything, make sure the token and who backs it are in your "Receivable Tokens" settings.  Similarly, before sending anything to a recipient, make sure the recipient has set their "Receivable Tokens" to be able to accept the token you are about to send.  All of this is done so that you do not accidentally receive tokens backed by people/companies you do not trust or know - for example, a fake USD token issued by a scammer.  In the general case, you do not need to do this for tokens you buy, sell, or issue, only for what others send you.  An exception is if an issuer requires token holders be authorized or approved, in which case you'll get a message that you need to add the token to your "Receivable Tokens" list before trading as well.  The one token that does not require any of this is Ripple's native currency XRP, which no one can issue and therefore can't be faked.  Note that Ripple's <a href='https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/#trust-lines-and-issuances' target='_blank'>Gateway documentation</a> refers to these lists as trustlines.  A video walk-through is also available on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5n7hap0kT4&index=4&list=PLHAK7FXoElZOyM6MaQ_O_i6ATap2k9r-o' target='_blank'>YouTube</a> for further clarity.</p>
          <p id='started_Laws'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href='#started_Laws' style='text-decoration:none; border:0;'>Laws, Regulations, and Taxes</a></b>: One thing to keep in mind is this site is only a tool; you are responsible for how you use it and to be aware of what the law allows or doesn't allow in relation to blockchain-based technologies.  The information on this site is by no means legal or investment advice, and you are solely responsible and liable for complying with such laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.  For buyers of tokens, make sure to confirm with local and federal laws that it is actually legal in your jurisdiction to hold or trade blockchain-based tokens.  Additionally, consult an accountant for properly filing taxes on any tokens you buy or sell; for most countries, trading of blockchain-based tokens is indeed taxable.  For those wanting to issue their own tokens, while we provide many tools and materials to get you issuing your own tokens more quickly, it is highly advised that you still seek legal counsel to ensure that your usage and deployment of such tokens complies with all laws and regulations.

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating new tokens to represent anything you want is as easy as just hitting the <a href='#' onclick='setURL("?action=issue"); $("#action").val("issue"); $("#symbol1").val(""); $("#symbol2").val(""); updateAction(); jQuery("html,body").animate({scrollTop: jQuery("#container").offset().top}, 1000); return false;'>Issue</a> button, but for those wanting to do a more formal "token offering" (aka ICO or ITO) to raise actual and significant funds, there are some extra business and legal considerations to keep in mind.  We outline a few common things to check off below, but this by no means is complete nor a substitute for actual legal counsel.  It is highly recommended you still consult with a law firm for your token.  Some groups that focus on this include <a href="http://www.debevoise.com/" target="_blank">Debevoise</a>, <a href='https://www.perkinscoie.com/' target='_blank'>Perkins Coie</a>, and <a href="https://argongroup.com/" target="_blank">Argon Group</a>.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For starters, a typical token offering will have, in addition to the token itself, a white paper describing the token purpose and a token purchase agreement outlining the legalities.  The former acts to convince people why they should support you and your token; the latter is to make sure you and the buyer do not get in trouble with the law and regulatory authorities.  Examples of these can be found on <a href='https://www.smithandcrown.com/icos/' target='_blank'>Smith and Crown</a> from other real token offerings.  We have also worked with third party law firms to provide a free <a href='Sample_Token_Purchase_Agreement.docx' target='_blank'>Sample Token Purchase Agreement</a>, which you can use to get started more quickly and should help cut down legal costs by not drafting from scratch.  Note though that this template is only for <b>non-security</b> tokens with actual utility use in a project.  If there is any likelihood of your token being regarded as a security or equity, definitely consult legal counsel to draft a proper proposal.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the technological side, more advanced users also may want to implement authorization of token holders and other compliance features, which are available under the "Advanced Settings" window.  A demo of a token that is only tradable amongst approved, whitelisted users is available <a href='https://www.theworldexchange.net/?symbol1=TTT.rBcA1MkS2jtywAAi9bWfGsUk9R6RWQAyKr&symbol2=XRP' target='_blank'>here</a>, which you'll notice can be viewed publicly but not purchased or sold unless your account has been authorized by the issuer (useful for satisfying KYC/AML requirements).  In addition, the default setting is for only the issuer to able to send or offer the token to others.  <b>If you would like users to be able to sell or send your token, make sure to enable the "defaultRipple" setting for your account.</b>  More information about the various settings and use cases for them can be found at Ripple's <a href='https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/' target='_blank'>Gateway</a> and <a href='https://ripple.com/build/rippleapi/' target='_blank'>API</a> documentationn  In general, remember that just because you're using a new technology like blockchain doesn't mean KYC/AML or other laws and regulations do not apply to you.  Fortunately, many functionalities that handle just that can be built right into the tokens themselves without additional code or smart contracts.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, if you're trying to raise funds for a project, cause, or business, it is still up to you to communicate and market that to the public.  The blockchain technology behind this site only provides a means to handle transactions for you and your users.  It is no different than linking to Paypal or Google Wallet to let others pay you but you still needing to build an online store to market and sell your product.  Here, you can link to The World Exchange with your unique token URL to let others buy or sell it, but you must still have your own site to explain what that token does and why others should use it.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, remember that this site is only a tool for the technology. Legal and business considerations have to still be taken care of on your end.  More importantly, laws and regulations are constantly evolving, especially for things relating to blockchain, so make sure to thoroughly understand them or consult someone who does before doing anything serious like a token sale.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the tech savy, The World Exchange is essentially a fully client-side wallet, a locally run tool that connects you directly with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> network.  This is the most secure way to interact with Blockchain / Ledger networks by sheer design.  Most exchange services turn themselves into a central point of failure by collecting user information which they must then secure.  <b>Our site is completely pass through and is an exchange in name only.  Nothing is stored or run through the site itself.</b>  You can test this yourself by saving the page and running it without actually coming to this site or by blocking theworldexchange.net on your firewall and seeing the page still work.  You can even disconnect your computer from the internet completely and just create an address to deposit funds into (aka a <a href='http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/30773/how-can-an-online-wallet-be-more-secure-than-paper-wallets-or-cold-storages' target='_blank'>cold wallet</a>).  It literally only runs on your computer.  For those that know how to code, you can also just right-click the site and view source to see that this only interacts with the Ripple API; it's all HTML/Javascript which by nature is open-source and viewable by anyone.  A <a href='https://github.com/Autodidactic-I/TheWorldExchange' target='_blank'>Github</a> project is also available for those who want something more spelled out. The site quite literally is just a direct user interface provided as-is and free of charge for you to use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> network.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying technology behind the scenes is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> consensus ledger designed to allow two parties to transmit between each other with no intermediary.  It is similar to Bitcoin's Blockchain technology except that it not only facilitates quick transactions with no middlemen, it also allows anyone to issue new tokens to represent value.  Whereas other cryptocurrencies are just that, currencies to be traded, Ripple is actually a full-on exchange through which anything can be issued and traded.  You can even trade other cryptocurrencies through Ripple itself.  Like Bitcoin, it is decentralized and distributed worldwide, meaning that there is no one who can interfere with your use and no one else is responsible for anything that happens except you.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple_(payment_protocol)' target='_blank'>Ripple</a> is actually a mature and well-established technology in industry that's been online since 2013.  <a href='https://www.ripple.com/' target='_blank'>Ripple Labs</a>, the company which created the technology, has already implemented the technology in many major U.S. banks.  The Ripple network itself is just sitting there on the internet with no barrier to entry or cost for anyone to connect to and use.  The technology being little known publicly and no one else having created a similar free, fully featured interface to the network is for a number of reasons:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b><a href='https://www.ripple.com/' target='_blank'>Ripple Labs</a> has pivoted to applying their technology just to speeding up bank transactions.</b>  That is but a sliver of what their technology is capable of, but as a company with many investors and private interests, they had to focus their use case.  As a result of their financial industry focus, they had to retreat from being too public with their work.  This combined with the stigma of the company having "sold out to banks" is why Ripple is less known today than it was in 2014 when it first started.  One could say that The World Exchange is effectively a replacement and spiritual successor to their former official wallet, <a href='http://www.rippletrade.com/' target='_blank'>RippleTrade</a>, which as a result of their pivot has been shut down and abandoned; in fact, RippleTrade accounts are directly usable with the same keys here at The World Exchange because it's the same Ripple network behind the scenes.</li>
          <li><b>The few other Ripple wallets or services that exist only store and exchange XRP as a currency, completely ignoring its decentralized exchange and numerous other features.</b>  Again, that is but a sliver of what Ripple's technology is capable of, but of the few other Ripple-supporting products that exist, virtually none of them showcase the fact that Ripple can do far more than just send money quickly.  Part of it is tied to Ripple Labs' pivot to bank transactions, which led to the developer community and ecosystem becoming largely neglected.  The other part is pure economics.  As <a href='#global' onclick='setURL("#global"); jQuery("html,body").animate({scrollTop: jQuery("#global").offset().top}, 1000); return false;'>described previously</a>, many cryptocurrency exchanges that do exist "re-invent the wheel" by way of becoming a traditional exchange themselves that just happens to list cryptocurrencies.  They do this so they can charge a fee for their services and insert themselves as the middleman blockchain technology was designed to eliminate.  If they were to simply provide access to the free, decentralized exchange that already exists within Ripple's technology itself, they would make themselves obsolete and have little chance to make a profit.  Which leads us to the final point...</li>
          <li><b>There is no business case for making something that is completely free.</b>  The World Exchange is a pure, vanilla, client-side tool for the Ripple network and charges nothing to use.  There is no extra process in between you and the network and no way for the creators of the website to profit.  No VC would ever fund a free-to-use platform with no way to make money.  Why did someone from <a href='https://www.autodidactic.ai/' target='_blank'>Autodidactic I</a> create it then? Autodidactic I is essentially an inventors/artists guild of individuals who have already created other ways to fund their own projects with no outside backers or interests. As a result, this and many other projects by members of that group tend to be profit-less in nature and done purely out of interest or just to see if it's possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that are free and open are very rare, and it is a natural human response to be skeptical.  The nice part is because this is free and open, you don't need to speculate.  Just go ahead and create an account to try things out with.  Do something with it or do nothing.  It is up to you.  The technology, however, is here and open to all.</p>

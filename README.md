# The World Exchange
www.theworldexchange.net

Very simple, "vanilla" site demonstrating much of Ripple/XRP's capabilities through their API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols, including Ripple's KYC features like allowing only authorized token holders.
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask books for any symbol.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers), including the ability to both generate and verify valid wallets/addresses completely offline by saving the webpage to your desktop.
- Bonus: Chat box feature running entirely on Ripple, decentralized and stored forever.

We welcome others to improve on the code and share; we're happy to update the site with any code improvements others make (after review etc of course).  Originally, we were going to do more with it but got spread too thin to devote meaningful time to this, so we figure it'd be best to open it up to the public as a community project.  At the very least, it should be helpful as working examples for much of Ripple's API functionality.

If there are any questions, feel free to ask or reach out at contact@theworldexchange.net

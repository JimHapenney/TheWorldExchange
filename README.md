# The World Exchange
www.theworldexchange.net

Very simple, "vanilla" site demonstrating most of Ripple/XRP's capabilities through their API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask books for any symbol.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers).

We welcome others to improve on the code and share; we're happy to update the site with any code improvements others make (after review etc of course).  Originally, we were going to do more with it but got spread too thin to devote meaningful time to this, so we figure it'd be best to open it up to the public as a community project.  At the very least, it should be helpful as working examples for much of Ripple's API functionality.

Apologies for the lack of comments and organization in the code (another thing that was intended to be done), but if there are any questions, feel free to ask or reach out at contact@theworldexchange.net

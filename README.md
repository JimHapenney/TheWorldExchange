# The World Exchange
www.theworldexchange.net

Very simple, "vanilla" site demonstrating much of Ripple/XRP's capabilities through their API, including but not limited to:
- Trading of symbols (buy/sell)
- Issuing new symbols, including Ripple's KYC features like allowing only authorized token holders.
- Sending/receiving symbols
- Bid/ask orderbooks for any symbol with autobridging implemented to connect all XRP-traded symbols.
- Fully client-side implementation for all the benefits of a "cold wallet" (no storing or passing of information on remote servers), including the ability to both generate and verify valid wallets/addresses completely offline by saving the webpage to your desktop.
- Bonus: Chat box feature running entirely on Ripple, decentralized and stored forever, doubles as a free notary because nothing can ever be changed or removed once it's up.

We welcome others to improve on the code and share; we're happy to update the site with any code improvements others make (after review etc of course).  Originally, we were going to do more with it but got spread too thin to devote meaningful time to this, so we figure it'd be best to open it up to the public as a community project.  At the very least, it should be helpful as working examples for much of Ripple's API functionality.

The site already is and always has been open-source by the fact that it's just pure HTML/Javascript, which anyone can right-click the page while viewing and see the source on.  This is just to satisfy those that still demand "open-source" without knowing they can just look at exactly what they're running while they're on the site.
